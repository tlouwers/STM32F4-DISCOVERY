# DAC
DAC peripheral driver class.

## Description
Intended use is to provide an easier means to work with the DAC peripheral. This class assumes the pins to use for the DAC are already configured.

## Requirements
- ST Microelectronics STM32F407G-DISC1 (can be ported easily to other ST microcontrollers)
- C++11
- Pins already configured for DAC

## Notes
<TODO>
 
## Example
```cpp
<TODO>
```
